### MS Excel

As a student and employee of the Hanze University of Applied Sciences Groningen, you can download the latest version of Microsoft Office for free. This applies to both Windows and MacOS and can be done on up to five devices.

How does it work?

- Go to the website https://portal.office.com.  
- Log in with the login details you received from the Hanze.
- Follow the on-screen instructions to download and install Office.

Please note:  
- You need a valid Hanze email address to download Office.
- After your graduation or departure from the Hanze, you will no longer be able to use Office.

After the installation, it is recommended to set the Office display language to English (so that all functions are set to English).   
To do so, choose `File > More... > Options > Language > English`

In addition, set the decimal separator to a dot.  

`File > More... > Options > Advanced > Use system separators`

Here you can deselect this option and set the decimal separator to a dot and the thousands separator to a comma.
