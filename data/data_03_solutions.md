|:----------------|:---------------|:----------------|
|Food Name        |Nominal         |Nominal          |
|Fat factor       |Continuous      |Ratio            |
|Analysed Portion |Continuous      |Ratio            |


### Exercise 2

|Item             |Calories (kcal/g)|

|Tofu             |144              |


### Exercise 3

Note that fahrenheit scale has no absolute zero (0 °F, was established as the freezing temperature of a solution of brine made from a mixture of water, ice, and ammonium chloride). As a result, we can not directly calculate a ratio as the fahrenheit scale is an interval scale. We first need to convert the data to Kelvin.

We can use the formula K = (F − 32) × 5 ⁄ 9 + 273.15

So will will get the following data:

recommended minimum temperature	145°F = 336 K
medium	160°F = 344 K
well done	170°F = 350 K

Ratio medium/recommended minimum temperature = 344/336 = 1.025
Ratio well done/recommended minimum temperature = 350/336 = 1.041

### Exercise 4

|Albania        |2026|7.50      |
|Algeria        |1996|0.27      |
|Algeria        |2026|0.90      |
|Netherlands    |1996|9.80      |
|Metherlands    |2026|8.70      |
