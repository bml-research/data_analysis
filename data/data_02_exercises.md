## Exercises

### Exercise 1

Download the [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vinitshah0110/food-composition).
Open it with a text editor (or Excel).

Decribe for the following columns what kind of data it holds. Also describe the scale.

|Column           |Data type       |Scale            |
|:----------------|:---------------|:----------------|
|Food Name        |                |                 |
|Fat factor       |                |                 |
|Analysed Portion |                |                 |

Food Name: nominal data, nominal scale
Fat factor: continuous, ratio scale
Analysed Portion: continuous, ratio scale


### Exercise 2

Have a look at some raw data below:

Item: Granola, Chicken Leg, Tofu, Salmon, Avocados
Calories (kcal) per 100 g: 489, 184, 144, 206, 160

Create a data table of the above data.
Make sure that the observations (or records) and variables (or features) are organised appropriately. Also sort the data based on the amount of calories.

### Exercise 3

Proper cooking temperatures are important for food safety.
The advice is to use proper cooking temperatures to ensure safe food.
See the data below for recommended temperatures:

Fresh beef, veal, lamb, pork, deer, moose, elk or caribou steaks, chops and roasts
recommended minimum temperature	145°F
medium	160°F
well done	170°F

What is the ratio for "medium" and "well done" compared to the recommended minimum temperature?

### Exercise 4

The R library Tidyverse will work best with tidy data.
Remember that there are three interrelated rules which make a dataset tidy:
- Each variable must have its own column.
- Each observation must have its own row.
- Each value must have its own cell.

Convert the datatable below to a datatable that is tidy.

Alcohol consumption in litres per year over time.

|Country        |1996  |2016  |
|:--------------|-----:|-----:|
|Albania        |2.59  |7.50  |
|Algeria        |0.27  |0.90  |
|Netherlands    |9.80  |8.70  |
