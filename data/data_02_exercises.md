## Exercises

### Exercise 1

Download the [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vinitshah0110/food-composition).
Open it with a text editor (or Excel).

Describe for the following columns what kind of data it holds. Also describe the scale.

|Column           |Data type       |Scale            |
|:----------------|:---------------|:----------------|
|Food Name        |                |                 |
|Fat factor       |                |                 |
|Analyzed Portion |                |                 |


### Exercise 2

Have a look at some raw data below:

Item: Granola, Chicken Leg, Tofu, Salmon, Avocados
Calories (kcal) per 100 g: 489, 184, 144, 206, 160

Create a data table of the above data.
Make sure that the observations (or records) and variables (or features) are organized appropriately. Also sort the data based on the amount of calories.

### Exercise 3

Proper cooking temperatures are important for food safety.
The advice is to use proper cooking temperatures to ensure safe food.
See the data below for recommended temperatures:

Fresh beef, veal, lamb, pork, deer, moose, elk or caribou steaks, chops and roasts
recommended minimum temperature	145°F
medium	160°F
well done	170°F

What is the ratio for "medium" and "well done" compared to the recommended minimum temperature?  

Hint: first calculate temperature in Kelvin. Next calculate the ratio.   
Formula:  

$K = (F − 32) × \frac{5}{9} + 273.15$  

### Exercise 4

The R library Tidyverse will work best with tidy data.
Remember that there are three interrelated rules which make a dataset tidy:
- Each variable must have its own column.
- Each observation must have its own row.
- Each value must have its own cell.

Convert the data table below to a data table that is tidy.

Alcohol consumption in litres per year over time.

|Country        |1996  |2016  |
|:--------------|-----:|-----:|
|Albania        |2.59  |7.50  |
|Algeria        |0.27  |0.90  |
|Netherlands    |9.80  |8.70  |

Also mention, which of the three interrelated rules which make a dataset tidy have not been met.

### Exercise 5

Another untidy data table. Describe which of the three interrelated rules which make a dataset tidy have not been met and convert the data table to a data table that is tidy.

|Country        |1996, 2016   |
|:--------------|------------:|
|Albania        |2.59, 7.50   |
|Algeria        |0.27, 0.90   |
|Netherlands    |9.80, 8.70   |

### Exercise 6

Here we have a tidy data table data table. Spread it in order to make it wider (and untidy).

|Country        |Year|Consumption type   |Volume (l)|
|:--------------|:---|:------------------|---------:|
|Albania        |1996|Alcohol            |2.59      |
|Albania        |1996|Bottled water      |120       |
|Albania        |2016|Alcohol            |7.50      |
|Albania        |2016|Bottled water      |131       |
|Algeria        |1996|Alcohol            |0.27      |
|Algeria        |1996|Bottled water      |144       |
|Algeria        |2016|Alcohol            |0.90      |
|Algeria        |2016|Bottled water      |154       |
