# R

## Basics of R

Before we start with importing data, some basics of R will be explained. Remember that we will try to avoid basic programming and focus on the use of the functions and tools provided by the Tidyverse library.


## RStudio

Before you can start doing data analysis, you need to install both R and RStudio.
Have a look at [this website](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html) how to do that.


We will work mostly with R-Markdown document.
This webpage that you are reading is currently in HTML but was written in RMarkdown in RStudio.

Have a look at the screenshot below:

![RStudio](./pics_01_basics/fig01.png)

The RStudio user interface has 4 primary panes:
From top left to bottum left in clockwise direction these are: 
- Source pane.
- Console pane.
- Environment pane, containing the Environment, History, Connections, Build, VCS , and Tutorial tabs.
- Output pane, containing the Files, Plots, Packages, Help, Viewer, and Presentation tabs.

RMarkdown is very convenient because you can mix the markdown markup language with R code.

There is very comprehensive documentation about R Markdown. See [this webpage](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).


### Some very basics of R

Although we will try to avoid base R as much as possible, you will need a bit of basics.

We can assign a variable in R as follows:

```{r}

x <- 42
print(x)
```

The very basic data structure of R is the vector.

It may contain whole numbers:

```{r}

my_nums <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
print(my_nums)
```

Or decimals:

```{r}

my_dec <- c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4)
print(my_dec)
```

Or text:

```{r}

my_txt <- c("Hello", "World")
print(my_txt)
```

Or Booleans:

```{r}

my_bools <- c("Hello", "World")
print(my_bools)
```

But what we will use is the dataframe. See it as a bunch of colums stitched together:

```{r}

my_df <- data.frame(my_nums, my_dec)
print(my_df)
```

Both the `c` and `data.frame` are functions in R.
You can call them using `function.name()` and pass data to it as arguments.

So in the above code the vectors assigned to the variable names my_nums and my_dec are tranferred as arguments in the data.frame function. This function returns a dataframe object that is assigned to the my_df variable name.


## Installing libraries

You can install the tidyverse library using:

```
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

## Loading packages:

You can load a package as follows:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


## Make a tibble

Now we can make a fancy type of dataframe from the tidyverse library:


```{r}
my_tibble <- tibble(my_df)
my_tibble
```
