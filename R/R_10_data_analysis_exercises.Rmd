This file can be downloaded [here](./R_10_data_analysis_exercises.Rmd)

> In order to compare the analysis in R with Excel, the exercises where kept as similar as possible. 

### Exercise 1

Import the [Nutrition facts data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mcdonalds/nutrition-facts) from a fastfood restaurant in an Rmd file. 
Then perfom the following calculations on a new worksheet and display them as a table:  

- Calculate the minimum, maximum, average, median from the columns `Calories` and `Calories from fat`. Display the answers in a data frame.  

```{r}
#Your code here
```


### Exercise 2

Index, filter and sort your data frame to answer the following questions:  
1. Which item has the highest Calories from fat?  
2. Which items have the highest Iron (% Daily Value)?  
3. Which Beef & Pork item has the lowest Calories from fat?  
4. Which Coffee & Tea or Smoothies & Shakes item has the highest amount of carbohydrates?  
5. Which item has the highest saturated fat and lowest carbohydrates value?  

Item  with the highest Calories from fat:
```{r}
#Your code here
```


Item  with the highest highest Iron (% Daily Value)
```{r}
#Your code here
```


Beef & Pork item with the lowest Calories from fat?  
```{r}
#Your code here
```

Coffee & Tea or Smoothies & Shakes item with the highest amount of carbohydrates:

```{r}
#Your code here
```


Item with the highest saturated fat and lowest carbohydrates value:

```{r}
#Your code here
```


### Exercise 3

1. More then 600 calories would be considered high energetic. How many items are high energetic?  
2. How many items are between 300 and 600 calories?  
3. How many items are measured in the serving size Fluid Ounce (fl oz cup) (hint: use a wildcard)?  

High energetic:

```{r}
#Your code here
```

Number of items between 300 and 600 calories:

```{r}
#Your code here
```

How many items are measured in the serving size Fluid Ounce (fl oz cup) (hint: use a wildcard)

```{r}
#Your code here
```


### Exersise 4

> Note that this exercise differs a bit from the Excel counterpart. We do not use conditional formatting but selection of rows instead.  

1. Select rows with high energetic food items (>600 calories). Which three categories show the highest number of red cells?  
2. Select rows with duplicate food items. Are there any duplicate items?  
3. Select rows with a % Daily Value > 100% for Vitamin A. Which category are these items mainly found? 
4. Select rows with a % Daily Value >= 100% for Vitamin C. Use green markup for these. Make sure that you include 100%! How many items do you find that meet this criteria?  

Select rows with high energetic food items (>600 calories). Which three categories show the highest number of red cells?  

```{r}
#Your code here
```

Select rows with duplicate food items. Are there any duplicate items?  

```{r}
#Your code here
```

There are no duplicates!

Select rows with a % Daily Value > 100% for Vitamin A. Which category are these items mainly found? 

```{r}
#Your code here
```

Select rows with a % Daily Value >= 100% for Vitamin C. Use green markup for these. Make sure that you include 100%! How many items do you find that meet this criteria?  

```{r}
#Your code here
```


### Exercise 5

> Note that this exercise differs a bit from the Excel counterpart. We do not use a pivot table but the results will be similar.  

Group the categories.  
Calculate:  
- the Average of Total Fat (% Daily Value)  
- the Average of Saturated Fat (% Daily Value)  
- the Average of Cholesterol (% Daily Value)  

Round the values to 1 decimal.  

```{r}
#Your code here
```
