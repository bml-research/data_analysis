### Exercise 1

Load the following datasets in R using the csv import functionality. First have a look at them in your text editor.  
Then load in R.  

- [file 1](./files_04_data_import_exercises/exercise01/Food_composition_1.csv)  
- [file 2](./files_04_data_import_exercises/exercise01/Food_composition_2.csv)  
- [file 3](./files_04_data_import_exercises/exercise01/Food_composition_3.csv)  
- [file 4](./files_04_data_import_exercises/exercise01/Food_composition_4.csv)  

Report the field separator.

File 1:

```{r}
file_path <- "./files_04_data_import_exercises/exercise01/Food_composition_1.csv"
df <- read_csv(file_path)
df
```

The field separator used was a comma. Therefore use the `read_csv` function.

File 2:

```{r}
file_path <- "./files_04_data_import_exercises/exercise01/Food_composition_2.csv"
df <- read_csv2(file_path)
df
```

The field separator used was a semi-colon. Therefore use the `read_csv2` function.

File 3:

```{r}
file_path <- "./files_04_data_import_exercises/exercise01/Food_composition_3.csv"
df <- read_delim(file_path, delim="|")
df
```

The field separator used was a pipe symbol. Therefore use the `read_delim` function with a `delim argument` set to the correct delimiter.

File 4:

```{r}
file_path <- "./files_04_data_import_exercises/exercise01/Food_composition_4.csv"
df <- read_delim(file_path, delim="@")
df
```

The field separator used was an at sign. Therefore use the `read_delim` function with a `delim argument` set to the correct delimiter.

### Exercise 2

Download this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/trolukovich/nutritional-values-for-common-foods-and-products).
Unzip it and import the csv data in R.

```{r}
file_path <- "./files_04_data_import_exercises/exercise02/nutrition.csv"
df <- read_csv(file_path)
df
```

As you can see, this dataset needs a lot of cleaning (the units are in the data fields) but that will be dealt with in a later chapter.

### Exercise 3

Download this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vaishnavivenkatesan/food-and-their-calories).
Unzip it and import the csv data in R.

```{r}
file_path <- "./files_04_data_import_exercises/exercise03/Food and Calories - Sheet1.csv"
df <- read_csv(file_path)
df
```

As you can see, this dataset needs cleaning (the units are in the data fields) but that will be dealt with in a later chapter.

### Exercise 4

Download this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amandaroseknudsen/foodproductemissions?resource=download).
Unzip it and import the csv data in R.

```{r}
file_path <- "./files_04_data_import_exercises/exercise04/Food_Product_Emissions.csv"
df <- read_csv(file_path)
df
```

### Exercise 5

Download data from [this website](https://ourworldindata.org/meat-production).
Search for Global meat production
Meat production across the world.
Download the csv file and import the csv data in R.

```{r}
file_path <- "./files_04_data_import_exercises/exercise05/global-meat-production.csv"
df <- read_csv(file_path)
df
```

### Exercise 6

Use R to create a csv file from the following table:

|Food product   |Processing  |Transport  |Packaging  |Retail  |
|:--------------|-----------:|----------:|----------:|-------:|
| Olive Oil     | 66         | 482       | 861       | 46     |
| Palm Oil      | 1264       | 208       | 886       | 44     |
| Rapeseed Oil  | 193        | 19        | 844       | 46     |
| Soybean Oil   | 311        | 299       | 849       | 43     |
| Sunflower Oil | 229        | 201       | 853       | 43     |


```{r}
food_product <- c("Olive Oil", "Palm Oil", "Rapeseed Oil", "Soybean Oil", "Sunflower Oil")
processing <- c(66, 1264, 193, 311, 229) 
transport <- c(482, 208, 19, 299, 201)
packaging <- c(861, 886, 844, 849, 853)
retail <- c(46, 44, 46, 43, 43)
my_tibble <- tibble(food_product, processing, transport, packaging, retail)
write_csv(my_tibble, "./files_05_data_import_solutions/exercise06/food_emission_data.csv")
```

To prove that the data was written to a csv file:

```{r}
file_path <- "././files_05_data_import_solutions/exercise06/food_emission_data.csv"
df <- read_csv(file_path)
df
```

### Exercise 7

Use the same data from exercise 6 but now create an Excel file. Make sure to include the column headers.

```{r}
library(openxlsx)
write.xlsx(my_tibble, "./files_05_data_import_solutions/exercise07/food_emission_data.xlsx", colNames = TRUE)
```


### Exercise 8

Use the Excel file from exercise 7 to open the Excel file.

```{r}
library(readxl)
my_data <- read_excel("./files_05_data_import_solutions/exercise07/food_emission_data.xlsx")
my_data
```
