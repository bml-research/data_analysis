## Data Import Exercises

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

### Exercise 1

Load the following datasets in R using the csv import functionality. First have a look at them in your text editor.  
Then load in R.  

- [file 1](./files_04_data_import_exercises/exercise01/Food_composition_1.csv)  
- [file 2](./files_04_data_import_exercises/exercise01/Food_composition_2.csv)  
- [file 3](./files_04_data_import_exercises/exercise01/Food_composition_3.csv)  
- [file 4](./files_04_data_import_exercises/exercise01/Food_composition_4.csv)  

Report the field separator.

File 1:

```{r}
file_path <- "./files_04_data_import_exercises/exercise01/Food_composition_1.csv"
df <- read_csv(file_path)
df
```

The field separator used was a comma. Therefore use the `read_csv` function.

File 2:

```{r}
file_path <- "./files_04_data_import_exercises/exercise01/Food_composition_2.csv"
df <- read_csv2(file_path)
df
```

The field separator used was a semi-colon. Therefore use the `read_csv2` function.

File 3:

```{r}
file_path <- "./files_04_data_import_exercises/exercise01/Food_composition_3.csv"
df <- read_delim(file_path, delim="|")
df
```

The field separator used was a pipe symbol. Therefore use the `read_delim` function with a `delim argument` set to the correct delimiter.

File 4:

```{r}
file_path <- "./files_04_data_import_exercises/exercise01/Food_composition_4.csv"
df <- read_delim(file_path, delim="@")
df
```

The field separator used was an at sign. Therefore use the `read_delim` function with a `delim argument` set to the correct delimiter.
