# R

## Data Cleaning Exercises

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

This file can be downloaded [here](./R_07_data_cleaning_exercises.Rmd)

### Exercise 1

[This](./files_07_data_cleaning_exercises/exercise01/calories.xlsx) first data set was not loaded well in Excel. Load the Excel file as a tibble in R. Separate the columns correctly.
Hint: use the `separate_wider_delim` function from tidyverse.

```{r}
#Your code here
```

### Exercise 2

The file from the previous exercise contains the units in the cells. This makes it impossible to perform calculations (as the data type is a text string). Remove the units in order to make calculations possible.

```{r}
#Your code here
```

### Exercise 3

[This](./files_07_data_cleaning_exercises/exercise03/Food Composition_mod.csv) data set contains rows with duplicate data. Load the data and remove the duplicates from the data table.

```{r}
#Your code here
```


### Exercise 4

[This](./files_07_data_cleaning_exercises/exercise04/nutrition.csv) data set contains empty data.

Make the empty elements more explicit in R by converting them to `NA`.
Count how many elements you have:

- in total
- with missing data
- without missing data

```{r}
#Your code here
```
