# R: Data Cleaning

## Data cleaning methods

Let's start with loading the tidyverse library:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


Whether you use Excel, R or Python, data cleaning will often be required for the data.
So here are some examples of data cleaning:

## Remove rows with missing values

Let's start with creating a tibble with missing data:

```{r}
category <- c("fruit", "vegetable", "vegetable", "fruit")
type <- c("apple", "broccoli", "cauliflower", "banana")
calories <- c(52.5, NA, NA, 89.4)

my_tibble <- tibble(category, type, calories)
my_tibble
```

As you can see, there are two rows with missing values (NA values).
Here is how to drop them:

```{r}
my_tibble_cleaned <- drop_na(my_tibble)
my_tibble_cleaned
```

Later on we will perform multiple manipulations on data frames.
To prevent overwriting the same variable each time, we will use a different synthax.
Tidyverse came up with a shorthand to prevent overwriting the same variable each time (called forward chaining):


```{r}
my_tibble_cleaned <- my_tibble %>% drop_na()
my_tibble_cleaned
```

The reason to do this will become clear later on.

## Renaming columns

```{r}
category <- c("fruit", "vegetable", "vegetable", "fruit")
x <- c("apple", "broccoli", "cauliflower", "banana")
calories <- c(52.5, 32.2, 25.7, 89.4)

my_tibble <- tibble(category, x, calories)
my_tibble
```

As you can see, the column x is a poor column name.
Here is how to rename column x to type:

```{r}
my_tibble_clean <- my_tibble %>% rename(type = x)
my_tibble_clean
```

## Reordering columns

```{r}
category <- c("fruit", "vegetable", "vegetable", "fruit")
type <- c("apple", "broccoli", "cauliflower", "banana")
calories <- c(52.5, 32.2, 25.7, 89.4)

my_tibble <- tibble(category, calories, type)
my_tibble
```

As you can see, calories becomes before type.
You might want to reorder columns. This is how to do that:

```{r}
my_tibble_clean <- my_tibble %>% select(category, type, calories)
my_tibble_clean
```

## Changing a columns data type

Be aware the R uses coersion when data types in a vector is not consistent:

```{r}
category <- c("fruit", "vegetable", "vegetable", "fruit")
x <- c("apple", "broccoli", "cauliflower", "banana")
calories <- c(52.5, 32.2, "25.7", 89.4) # Note that this vector contains a string.

my_tibble <- tibble(category, type, calories)
my_tibble
```

As a result of a single string value the whole column calories is coerced to characters instead of doubles.
You can change that using the `mutate()` function:

```{r}
my_tibble_clean <- my_tibble %>% mutate(calories = as.numeric(calories))
my_tibble_clean
```

## Deal with missing data from csv files

How to deal with missing data from csv files?
Obviously, you can not make up data.
The best thing to do is to "mark"  them with `NA`. 

```{r}
my_path = './files_06_data_cleaning/file01_fruits.csv'
my_df <- read_csv2(my_path)
my_df
```

As you can see, the calorie data for broccoli is missing. Instead a forward slash is included indicating that the data is missing.
Note that the column is coerced to character.
Let's correct that:

```{r}
my_path = './files_06_data_cleaning/file01_fruits.csv'
my_df <- read_csv2(my_path, na = "/")
my_df
```

If multiple type of "empty" data are present in your dataset:

```{r}
my_path = './files_06_data_cleaning/file02_fruits.csv'
my_df <- read_csv2(my_path)
my_df
```

You can use a vector in the `NA =` parameter:

```{r}
my_path = './files_06_data_cleaning/file02_fruits.csv'
my_df <- read_csv2(my_path, na = c("/", "-"))
my_df
```

## Deal with missing data from Excel files

Like csv files, Excel files can have missing data too:

![fig1](./pics_06_data_cleaning/fig1.png)
Now if we load the data the following will happen:

```{r}
library(readxl)
my_path = './files_06_data_cleaning/file03_fruits.xlsx'
my_df <- read_excel(my_path)
my_df
```

Like for csv files, we can specify the missing values:

```{r}
my_path = './files_06_data_cleaning/file03_fruits.xlsx'
my_df <- read_excel(my_path, na=  c("/", "-"))
my_df
```

What if cells are left blank?

![fig1](./pics_06_data_cleaning/fig2.png)
If we load the data:

```{r}
my_path = './files_06_data_cleaning/file04_fruits.xlsx'
my_df <- read_excel(my_path)
my_df
```

As you can see, the read_excel function deals with them automatically.


## Replace data

Imagine we have a clear erroneous data item:


```{r}
category <- c("fruit", "vegetable", "vegetable", "fruit")
type <- c("apple", "broccoli", "cauliflower", "banana")
calories <- c(52.5, 999,25.7, 89.4)
my_tibble <- tibble(category, type, calories)
my_tibble
```

The 999 calories for broccoli should be replaced with 34.2.

Replacing this specific data point can be done as follows: 

```{r}
my_tibble[2,3] <- 34.2
my_tibble
```

Replacing data in whole row:


Replacing data in whole column:


Replacing data in entire data frame:
