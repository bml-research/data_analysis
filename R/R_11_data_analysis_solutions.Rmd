> In order to compare the analysis in R with Excel, the exercises where kept as similar as possible. 

### Exercise 1

Import the [Nutrition facts data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mcdonalds/nutrition-facts) from a fastfood restaurant in an Rmd file. 
Then perfom the following calculations on a new worksheet and display them as a table:  

- Calculate the minimum, maximum, average, median from the columns `Calories` and `Calories from fat`. Display the answers in a data frame.  

First load the data:
```{r}
file_path <- "./files_10_data_analysis_exercises/exercise01/menu.csv"
df <- read_csv(file_path)
formatted_table(head(df))
```
Then the calculations:
```{r}
min_cal <- min(df$Calories)
max_cal <- max(df$Calories)
mean_cal <- mean(df$Calories)
median_cal <- median(df$Calories)

min_fat <- min(df$`Calories from Fat`)
max_fat <- max(df$`Calories from Fat`)
mean_fat <- mean(df$`Calories from Fat`)
median_fat <- median(df$`Calories from Fat`)

results_ex1 <- tibble("measure" = c("minimum", "maximum", "mean", "median"), 
                      "calories" = c(min_cal, max_cal, mean_cal, median_cal),
                      "calories from fat" = c(min_fat, max_fat, mean_fat, median_fat)
                      )

formatted_table(results_ex1)
```

Note that the summary function also provides easy access to this data:

```{r}
"Summary data calories"
summary(df$Calories)
"Summary data calories from fat"
summary(df$`Calories from Fat`)
```


### Exercise 2

Index, filter and sort your data frame to answer the following questions:  
1. Which item has the highest Calories from fat?  
2. Which items have the highest Iron (% Daily Value)?  
3. Which Beef & Pork item has the lowest Calories from fat?  
4. Which Coffee & Tea or Smoothies & Shakes item has the highest amount of carbohydrates?  
5. Which item has the highest saturated fat and lowest carbohydrates value?  

Item  with the highest Calories from fat:
```{r}
formatted_table(df[df$`Calories from Fat` == max(df$`Calories from Fat`), ])
```

Chicken McNuggets (40 piece)

or:
```{r}
formatted_table(filter(df, `Calories from Fat` == max(df$`Calories from Fat`)))
```
Chicken McNuggets (40 piece)

Item  with the highest highest Iron (% Daily Value)
```{r}
formatted_table(df[df$`Iron (% Daily Value)` == max(df$`Iron (% Daily Value)`), ])
```

Big Breakfast with Hotcakes (Regular Biscuit)
Big Breakfast with Hotcakes (Large Biscuit)

or:
```{r}
formatted_table(filter(df, `Iron (% Daily Value)` == max(df$`Iron (% Daily Value)`)))
```

Big Breakfast with Hotcakes (Regular Biscuit)
Big Breakfast with Hotcakes (Large Biscuit)

Beef & Pork item with the lowest Calories from fat?  
```{r}
formatted_table(df %>% 
  arrange(Category, `Calories from Fat`) %>%
  filter(Category == "Beef & Pork") %>%
  slice(1:1))
```

Hamburger

Coffee & Tea or Smoothies & Shakes item with the highest amount of carbohydrates:

```{r}
formatted_table(df %>% 
  filter(Category == "Coffee & Tea" | Category == "Smoothies & Shakes") %>%
  arrange(-`Carbohydrates`) %>%
  slice(1:1))
```


Item with the highest saturated fat and lowest carbohydrates value:

```{r}
formatted_table(df %>% 
  arrange(-`Saturated Fat`, `Carbohydrates`) %>%
  slice(1:1))
```

FrappÃ© Chocolate Chip (Large)


### Exercise 3

1. More then 600 calories would be considered high energetic. How many items are high energetic?  
2. How many items are between 300 and 600 calories?  
3. How many items are measured in the serving size Fluid Ounce (fl oz cup) (hint: use a wildcard)?  

High energetic:

```{r}
nrow(df[df$Calories > 600, ])
```
37 items

Number of items between 300 and 600 calories:

```{r}
nrow(df[df$Calories > 300 & df$Calories < 600, ])
```

106 items

How many items are measured in the serving size Fluid Ounce (fl oz cup) (hint: use a wildcard)

```{r}
nrow(df[str_detect(df$`Serving Size`, "fl oz cup"), ])
```

138 items

### Exersise 4

> Note that this exercise differs a bit from the Excel counterpart. We do not use conditional formatting but selection of rows instead.  


Select rows with high energetic food items (>600 calories). Which three categories show the highest number of red cells? 

```{r}
formatted_table(df %>%
  filter(Calories > 600))
```

Breakfast and Chicken & Fish and Smoothies and shakes

Select rows with duplicate food items. Are there any duplicate items?   

```{r}
df %>% 
  group_by(Item) %>% 
  filter(n()>1)
```

There are no duplicates!

Select rows with a % Daily Value > 100% for Vitamin A. Which category are these items mainly found?   

```{r}
formatted_table(df %>%
  filter(`Vitamin A (% Daily Value)` > 100))
```

Salads

Select rows with a % Daily Value >= 100% for Vitamin C. Use green markup for these. Make sure that you include 100%! How many items do you find that meet this criteria? 

```{r}
formatted_table(df %>%
  filter(`Vitamin C (% Daily Value)` >= 100))
```

The number of items:

```{r}
nrow(df %>%
  filter(`Vitamin C (% Daily Value)` >= 100))
```
7

### Exercise 5

> Note that this exercise differs a bit from the Excel counterpart. We do not use a pivot table but the results will be similar.  

Group the categories.  
Calculate:  
- the Average of Total Fat (% Daily Value)  
- the Average of Saturated Fat (% Daily Value)  
- the Average of Cholesterol (% Daily Value)  

Round the values to 1 decimal.  

```{r}
formatted_table(df %>% 
  group_by(Category) %>% 
  summarize("Mean Total Fat (% Daily Value)" = round(mean(`Total Fat (% Daily Value)`), 1),
            "Mean Saturated Fat (% Daily Value)" = round(mean(`Saturated Fat (% Daily Value)`), 1),
            "Mean Cholesterol (% Daily Value)" = round(mean(`Cholesterol (% Daily Value)`), 1)
            ))
```
