# R: Data Analysis

## Data analysis methods

Let's start with loading the tidyverse library:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


Here we will focus on data transformation and analysis.
We will filter rows with filter(), arrange rows with arrange() and select columns with select().
In addition, we will make grouped summaries using summarize().
At last, we will do some basic calculations. Note that plotting data will be the subject of the next section.
