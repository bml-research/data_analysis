# R: Data Analysis

## Data analysis methods

Let's start with loading the tidyverse library:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


Here we will focus on data transformation and analysis.
We will filter rows with filter(), arrange rows with arrange() and select columns with select().
In addition, we will make grouped summaries using summarize().
At last, we will do some basic calculations. Note that plotting data will be the subject of the next section.

>Note: R is like a swiss army knife. Extremely powerfull but also very eloborate.
>It is impossible to cover all analysis functions of R.
>So this is not a complete guide for data analysis. Instead, I will focus on some common tasks.
>You can always elaborate your analysis by exploring the tidyverse documentation. Or even use the base R documentation if the specific task you want to perform some custom tasks.

## Loading a dataset

As an example dataset, we will be using the same dataset as used in the Excel section:
namely, [the nutritional facts dataset from a fastfood restaurant](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mcdonalds/nutrition-facts)

```{r}
file_path <- "./files_09_data_analysis/file01_menu.csv"
df <- read_csv(file_path)
head(df)
```

As you can see above, the data is loaded well. Also note that the columns are of the correct data type (e.g. dbl for the Calories column).


## Select rows by index

Yoy can select rows by index using the following notation:

```{r}
df[2, ] #select second row
```

Note the comma between the brackets. Since there is no specification of a column, all columns are selected.

## Select column by index


You can also select a column based on an index:

```{r}
head(df[, 4]) #select fourth column
```

The head function was used to truncate the output.

## Select column by name

You can also select a column by name:

```{r}
head(df$Calories) #select column Calories
```

Note that this action returns a vector instead of a dataframe.


## Select item by index

You can also select a specific item by index:

```{r}
df[2, 4] #select second row and fourth column
```

Now we have the value of the second row and the fourth column.

## Filter rows

One of the most frequent tasks that you will be doing on data frames is filtering rows.
Here is how that works:

Filter rows with high caloric values:

```{r}
filter(df, Calories > 900)
```

Chicken and Fish meals with high calories:

```{r}
filter(df, Category == "Chicken & Fish" & Calories > 900)
```

Meals with high calories that do not belong to the Chicken and Fish category:

```{r}
filter(df, !Category == "Chicken & Fish" & Calories > 900)
```

Meals with very low or very high calories:

```{r}
filter(df, Calories < 100 | Calories > 900)
```

All meals with 0 calories:

```{r}
filter(df, Calories == 0)
```

## Arranging rows

You can use arrange() instead of filter if you want to sort your rows in a data frame instead of filtering it:

Arrange on calories ascending:

```{r}
arrange(df, Calories)
```


If you want to sort in descending order:

```{r}
arrange(df, desc(Calories))
```

And to select the row with the highest value:

```{r}
arrange(df, desc(Calories))[1, ]
```

You can also do some multi-level sorting:

Here is an example of sorting on Category first and then sorting on Calories: 

```{r}
arrange(df, Category, Calories)
```

Here is an example of sorting on Category first and then sorting on Calories from high to low: 

```{r}
arrange(df, Category, desc(Calories))
```


>Note: Missing values will always be sorted at the end.


## Select columns with select

You have learned that Variables in data sets should be arranged in columns. Often data sets contain a lot of variables (columns). Most likely, you are not interested in all of them.
With the select() function, you can select the variables that you are interested in:

```{r}
select(df, Category, Item, Calories)
```

Or select all columns except the Calories:

```{r}
select(df, -Calories)
```

Or select besides the first two columns, all columns with total in the name:

```{r}
select(df, Category, Item, starts_with("total"))
```


## Summary data

You can use the base R summary() function to get summary information on a data frame:

```{r}
summary(df)
```

As this output can be quit overwhelming you may select for the data that you are interested in (for example calories):

```{r}
summary(df$Calories)
```

But the Tidyverse library also contains a summarize() function:

```{r}
summarize(df, Calories = mean(Calories))
```

You can combine this with the group_by() function for powerful analysis:

```{r}
by_category <- group_by(df, Category)
summarize(by_category, Average_calories = mean(Calories))
```

Recall that this looks very much like the pivot table function in Excel (see figure 28 at [data analysis Excel](https://bml-research.github.io/data_analysis/excel/excel_08_data_analysis.html)).

To create a similar output as the pivot tables in Excel:

```{r}
by_category <- group_by(df, Category)
summarize(by_category, average_calories = mean(Calories), average_calories_fat = mean(`Calories from Fat`))
```

>Note that backticks were used to call the column name `Calories from Fat`.
>You can also deal with that by renaming column names and replacing spaces with underscores.


Now compare this output with figure 28 at [data analysis Excel](https://bml-research.github.io/data_analysis/excel/excel_08_data_analysis.html).

Likewise, you can extend this by providing the standard deviation:

```{r}
by_category <- group_by(df, Category)
summarize(by_category, average_calories = mean(Calories), sd_calories = sd(Calories), average_calories_fat = mean(`Calories from Fat`), sd_calories_from_fat = sd(`Calories from Fat`))

```

## Round values

In R you can round functions using the round() function:

```{r}
round(2.40, digits = 1)
round(2.45, digits = 1)
round(2.45) #defaults to 0 digits
round(2.5) #defaults to 0 digits
?round
```

>Note that for rounding off a 5, the IEC 60559 standard (see also ‘IEEE 754’) is expected to be used, ‘go to the even digit’. Therefore round(0.5) is 0 and round(-1.5) is -2.

So if you like your values to be rounded in the example above, just wrap it in the round function:


```{r}
by_category <- group_by(df, Category)
summarize(by_category, average_calories = round(mean(Calories)), sd_calories = round(sd(Calories)), average_calories_fat = round(mean(`Calories from Fat`)), sd_calories_from_fat = round(sd(`Calories from Fat`)))

```

## Statistics

R is build for statistics so you can do all kind of sophisticated statistics in R.
As this is not a statistics course, the use of statistics is beyond the scope of this course.

Some very basic functions that might be useful (all applied on the Calories column):

```{r}
print("mean")
mean(df$Calories)
print("min")
min(df$Calories)
print("max")
max(df$Calories)
print("median") 
median(df$Calories)
print("percentile")
quantile(df$Calories, c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75))
print("standard deviation")
sd(df$Calories)
print("standard error of the mean")
sd(df$Calories)/sqrt(length(df$Calories)) #can also be calculated using the plotrix package
```

## Summarize each

Using Tidyverse, you can also apply some of the above statistics more conveniently using the summarize_each function:

```{r}
by_category <- group_by(df, Category)
summarize_each(by_category, funs(mean, sd, se=sd(.)/sqrt(n())))
```

Note that the `se=sd(.)/sqrt(n())` code is a custom made function to calculate the standard error of the mean.

As you can see, Item_mean and Serving Size_mean are not informative. These were of the character type.
So it is best to omit them:

```{r}
by_category <- group_by(df, Category)
summarize_each(by_category, funs(mean, sd, se=sd(.)/sqrt(n()))) %>%
  select(-Item_mean, -`Serving Size_mean`)
```

We could simplify this expression by using pipes.You can use %>% to emphasise a sequence of actions.

```{r}
df %>%
  group_by(Category) %>%
  summarize_each(funs(mean, sd, se=sd(.)/sqrt(n()))) %>%
  select(-Item_mean, -`Serving Size_mean`)
```

Piping greatly reduces the complexity of your actions and prevents the creation of temporary variables.
You can read it as:
First take the data frame `df` then,
group the data frame by the items in the column `Category` and then,
summarize each `category` item for `mean`, `sd` and `se` and then,
select all columns except `Item_mean` and `Serving Size_mean`.
