# R: Data Import


## Data Import Exercises

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

### Exercise 1

Load the following datasets in R using the csv import functionality. First have a look at them in your text editor.  
Then load in R.  

- [file 1](./files_04_data_import_exercises/exercise01/Food_composition_1.csv)  
- [file 2](./files_04_data_import_exercises/exercise01/Food_composition_2.csv)  
- [file 3](./files_04_data_import_exercises/exercise01/Food_composition_3.csv)  
- [file 4](./files_04_data_import_exercises/exercise01/Food_composition_4.csv)  

Report the field separator.



### Exercise 2

Download this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/trolukovich/nutritional-values-for-common-foods-and-products).
Unzip it and import the csv data in R.

```{r}
#Your code here
```

As you can see, this dataset needs a lot of cleaning (the units are in the data fields) but that will be dealt with in a later chapter.

### Exercise 3

Download this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vaishnavivenkatesan/food-and-their-calories).
Unzip it and import the csv data in R.

```{r}
#Your code here
```

As you can see, this dataset needs cleaning (the units are in the data fields) but that will be dealt with in a later chapter.

### Exercise 4

Download this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amandaroseknudsen/foodproductemissions?resource=download).
Unzip it and import the csv data in R.

```{r}
#Your code here
```

### Exercise 5

Download data from [this website](https://ourworldindata.org/meat-production).
Search for Global meat production
Meat production across the world.
Download the csv file and import the csv data in R.

```{r}
#Your code here
```

### Exercise 6

Use R to create a csv file from the following table:

| Food product  | Processing | Transport | Packaging | Retail |
|---------------|------------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Olive Oil     | 66         | 482       | 861       | 46     |
| Palm Oil      | 1264       | 208       | 886       | 44     |
| Rapeseed Oil  | 193        | 19        | 844       | 46     |
| Soybean Oil   | 311        | 299       | 849       | 43     |
| Sunflower Oil | 229        | 201       | 853       | 43     |


```{r}
#Your code here
```

To prove that the data was written to a csv file:

```{r}
#Your code here
```

### Exercise 7

Use the same data from exercise 6 but now create an Excel file. Make sure to include the column headers.

```{r}
#Your code here
```


### Exercise 8

Use the Excel file from exercise 7 to open the Excel file.

```{r}
#Your code here
```
