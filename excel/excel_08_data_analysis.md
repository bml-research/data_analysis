## Introduction

Now that the data is imported and cleaned. It is time to analyse the data. 
This means that, depending on your specific question, you can do all sorts of calculations using Excel formulas (you can even create custom formulas), sort data, perform conditional formatting and create pivot tables. The creation of plots will be dealt with in the next chapter.


## How to organise your worksheet

Imagine that you would like to calculate the total percentage. Obviously, the easiest way to do this is to add a column to the table and calculate the sum of percentages using the `SUM` formula:

We first resize the table to the appropriate dimension:
