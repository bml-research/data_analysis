### Exercise 3

Find the solution in the link below.

[nutritional-values-for-common-foods-and-products](./files_04_import_solutions/exercise03/nutrition.xlsx)

As you can see from this file, the units are in the cells instead of the column headers.

![import](./files_04_import_solutions/exercise03/fig1.png)

Therefore, all fileds are strings instead of numbers.
This requires cleaning before you can do any calculations!

### Exercise 4

During the import, the column headers where not placed as such.
See figure below:

![import](./files_04_import_solutions/exercise04/fig1.png)

To fix this, click `Transform Data` and then `Use First Row as Headers`.

![import](./files_04_import_solutions/exercise04/fig2.png)

The column headers are now loaded well:
