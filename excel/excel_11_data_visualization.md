## Introduction

Though not as powerfull as R or Python, Excel is a user friendly tool for data analysis and visualization. Whether you're working in the food industry or conducting research on nutrition, Excel can help you make sense of your data and present your findings in a clear and compelling way. By using Excel's built-in charting features, you can easily create a variety of charts and graphs that visualize key trends and patterns in your data, such as changes in nutrient levels over time, differences between different food products, or correlations between different variables. With Excel, you can create professional-looking charts and graphs that are easy to understand and can help you communicate your insights to others. Excel offers a wide range of tools and capabilities that can help you make sense of your food-related data and present it in a way that is meaningful and informative.


## Data visualization charts in Excel

Excel offers a wide variety of chart types, which can be customized to suit your data and presentation needs. Some of the most commonly used chart types in Excel include:
- Column charts: Used to compare values across different categories or to show changes over time.
- Line charts: Used to show trends over time or to compare trends between multiple data sets.
- Pie charts: Used to show how different categories contribute to a whole.
- Bar charts: Similar to column charts, but with horizontal bars instead of vertical columns.
- Scatter charts: Used to show the relationship between two variables.
- Area charts: Similar to line charts, but with the area between the line and the x-axis filled in.
- Radar charts: Used to compare multiple data sets across different categories.
- Surface charts: Used to show trends in three-dimensional data.
- Bubble charts: Similar to scatter charts, but with bubbles of different sizes to represent the data points.

These are just a few of the chart types available in Excel. With its robust set of charting features, Excel offers a wide range of options for visualizing your data and communicating your insights to others.


## What makes a good chart?

A good chart is one that effectively communicates your data in a clear and concise manner. Here are some key characteristics of a good chart:
- Accuracy: The data in the chart should be accurate and clearly labeled. Any sources of error or uncertainty should be clearly indicated.
- Clarity: The chart should be easy to read and understand. The axes and labels should be clearly labeled (with units), and any legends or annotations should be concise and to the point.
- Simplicity: The chart should be simple and straightforward, avoiding unnecessary clutter or complexity (such as colored bars when they are not informative). The message of the chart should be clear and easily - understandable at a glance.
- Relevance: The chart should be relevant to the audience and the purpose of the presentation. It should highlight the key insights or trends in the data, and should be designed with the audience's needs and interests in mind.
- Aesthetics: The chart should be visually appealing and professional-looking, with clear, readable fonts and colors that complement the data being presented.

By focusing on these key characteristics, you can create charts that effectively communicate your data and insights, and help you to make better-informed decisions based on your data.
