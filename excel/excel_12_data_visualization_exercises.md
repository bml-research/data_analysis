### Exercise 1

Load the [Food Emissions](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amandaroseknudsen/foodproductemissions?resource=download) dataset from Kaggle.

Create a column chart for the `Total Global Average GHG Emissions per kg` per `food product`.

Create the column chart on a new worksheet.
Annotate the axis and add a proper title.

What food product creates the highest Emission value?


### Exercise 2

As the differences in the values are rather high, it is wise to use a log scale to display your data. Log scales have their advantages and are often used to display data that cover a wide range of values. Use a 2log scale to display your data.
