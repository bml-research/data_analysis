## Exercises

---

### Exercise 1

Load the [Food Emissions](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amandaroseknudsen/foodproductemissions?resource=download) dataset from Kaggle.

Create a column chart for the `Total Global Average GHG Emissions per kg` per `food product`.

Create the column chart on a new worksheet.
Annotate the axis and add a proper title.

What food product creates the highest Emission value?


### Exercise 2

As the differences in the values are rather high, it is wise to use a log scale to display your data. Log scales have their advantages and are often used to display data that cover a wide range of values. Use a 2log scale to display your data.

### Exercise 3

From the previous dataset, filter the data that contain oil in the name.  
Create a clustered column chart representing the Emissions per kg from `Processing`, `Transport`, `Packaging` and `Retail`. Make sure to add proper axis titles, a title and a legend.

### Exercise 4

Use the same data as from exercise 3 to create a stacked column chart. Filter the data that contain oil in the name.  
Create a stacked column chart representing the Emissions per kg from `Processing`, `Transport`, `Packaging` and `Retail`. Make sure to add proper axis titles, a title and a legend.

### Exercise 5

Use the same data as from exercise 3 to create a relative stacked column chart. Filter the data that contain oil in the name.  
Create a relative stacked column chart representing the Emissions per kg from `Processing`, `Transport`, `Packaging` and `Retail`. Make sure to add proper axis titles, a title and a legend.


### Exercise 6

Use the same data as from exercise 3 to create a pie chart. Filter the data that contain oil in the name.  
Create a pie chart representing the Emissions per kg from `Processing`, `Transport`, `Packaging` and `Retail`. Make sure to add proper axis titles, a title, data labels and a legend.
